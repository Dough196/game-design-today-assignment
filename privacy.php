                <h3 class="mt-5">Sales of Personal Information</h3>
                <p>Under the CCPA, a “sale” means providing to a third party personal information for valuable consideration. It does not necessarily mean money was exchanged for the transfer of personal information. We have taken substantial steps to identify whether any of our data sharing arrangements would constitute a “sale” under the CCPA. Due to the complexities and ambiguities in the CCPA, we will continue to evaluate some of our third-party relationships as we wait for final implementing regulations and guidance. For example, it is currently unclear whether the use of certain types of advertising partners would be considered a sale under CCPA. Additionally, while we do sell information to educational institutions and educational service companies, we do so only at the intentional direction and request of a consumer, and therefore, we believe those sales fall under one of the exceptions to the definition of “sale” under the CCPA. We will continue to update our business practices as regulatory guidance becomes available and provides clarity on what constitutes a sale transaction, particularly in the advertising ecosystem.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-3">Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
                <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Calling us at 408-641-0859.</li>
                    <li>Emailing us at info@Game Design Today.com.</li>
                    <li>Visiting www.Game Design Today.com.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
                <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
                <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>
                <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3 class="mt-3">Response Timing and Format</h3>
                <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
                <p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>
                <p>For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
